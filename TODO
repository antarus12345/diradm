This is a listing of the incomplete functionality in diradm.

shadow stuff:
- passwd cmd: chfn, chsh, chage, gpasswd, passwd modes.

group stuff:
- gpasswd cmd: admin and password functionality.

Patches welcome to implement this stuff. The gpasswd things will be very
difficult as they are not in any published LDAP schema I have found.
