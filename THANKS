No thanks to (yes, this is rant):
---------------------------------
ACS/OTS @ SFU Burnaby: 
Not all of you, just a select few in Management that canned my account during
the development of diradm. While checking to see to  see that diradm would
would on Solaris, I  reported that your out of date Solaris shellbox had an
unlocked getent command, that made all passwords public on the machine, and
also to all public LDAP queries from outside the university. 

In return, you barred me from my work with SFU for some time, forever damaging
my opinions of the management practices of SFU.

I've got the last laugh now, as the release of 2.7 is the first time that
diradm should actually work on IRIX, and I've only fixed it because I don't
hold anything against those in ACS/OTS that actually get any work done.
