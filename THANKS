Thanks to:
----------
Gordon Pritchard <gordonp _ sfu _ ca>:
Putting up with my development of diradm on the TechBC research network, to
make everybodies life easier.

Andreas de Pretis <andreas _ depretis _ at>:
useradd -h, home directory stuff.

Klavs Klavsen <kl _ vsen _ dk>:
Debugging in Denmark. Linux and FreeBSD patches.

Keith Hightower <khightower _ merkleinc _ com>:
For being willing to work through the problems more than many other users that
simply said "It doesn't work, wahaa, I'm leaving".

Eric Thibodeau <kyron _ neuralbs _ com>:
For being willing to use diradm for his SoC project :-), and also for finding
the UID generation bug. Gentoo bug #230209.

Horatiu Halmaghi <hha13 _ sfu _ ca>:
For pointing out that my UID generation fix still didn't work quite perfectly,
and needed more polish :-).

No thanks to (yes, this is a rant):

ACS/OTS @ SFU Burnaby: 
Not all of you, just a select few in Management that canned my account during
the development of diradm. While checking to see to see that diradm would would
on Solaris, I privately reported to your secure channels that your out of date
Solaris shellbox had an unlocked 'getent shadow' command, that made all
passwords public on the machine, and also to all public LDAP queries from
outside the university. 

In return, you barred me from my work with SFU for some time, forever damaging
my opinions of the management practices of SFU.

I've got the last laugh now, as the release of 2.7 is the first time that
diradm should actually work on IRIX, and I've only fixed it because I don't
hold anything against those in ACS/OTS that actually get any work done.
