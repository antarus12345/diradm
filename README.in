Welcome to @PACKAGE@ @VERSION@.

diradm-2* is based on an older package of the same name, which is available
here: http://www.hits.at/diradm/.

This new version is a rewrite in the same style of the older version,
incorporating significant new functionality, and changes across the board. It
now presents a near complete suite of POSIX management tools (like the linux
'shadow' package) aimed at providing all functionality to change
/etc/{shadow,group,passwd,hosts,ethers} style data in LDAP.

Additionally, there are some features intended for larger networks:
- support for all Samba user attributes.
- Samba domain host management.
- support for automount/autofs maps.
- support for multiple password hashes
- email attribute on users.

diradm not behaving? See DEBUGGING.

There are a number of pieces of unfinished functionality in this package still.
Please see KNOWN-BUGS for a discussion on them.
