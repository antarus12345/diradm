Diradm does contain a mode to enable it to be used actively for developing,
without having to install.

1. Grab the tarball or a CVS checkout
2. Unpack
3. If using a CVS checkout, run ./reconf
4. ./configure --enable-automount --enable-irixpasswd --enable-samba # customize as needed
5. cd src
6. libexecdir=. sysconfdir/etc ./diradm ...
7. Change the sysconfdir variable to '.' if you want to use the config file in the current directory.
8. If you want to change something, edit the corresponding .in file and run make.
9. For more debugging output, run with DEBUG=1 in your environment.
